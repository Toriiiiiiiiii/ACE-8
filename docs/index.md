## Introduction

The ACE-8 is an 8-bit fantasy console inspired by Atari's early 8-bit
computers and the Pico-8. The idea for the project arose from the OLC
codejam 2024, which had the theme "Run". Unfortunately, I was unable
to complete the project in enough time for the jam. 

The system has a rather basic architecture, with minimal graphics, sound
and only 32 instructions. Despite this, designing and documenting the system
has been a challenge that I have very much enjoyed undertaking.
